# Project Title

## Note
Please note that while this project has been set up and programmed to function correctly, I was unable to perform final testing and debugging due to the lack of an access token. I am confident in the setup and the implementation; however, the final testing phase could not be completed. Access to the necessary token would enable me to verify and fine-tune the functionalities.

## Overview
This repository contains a full-stack application with a React-based frontend and a Node.js backend, all housed within a single project directory. The project is structured into two main folders: `client` for the React application and `server` for the Node.js backend.

## Prerequisites
Before you start, ensure you have the following installed:
- Node.js
- npm (Node Package Manager)

## Installation
To get the application running, you need to install dependencies for both the client and the server.

### Setting up the Server
Navigate to the server directory from the project root and install its dependencies:
```bash
cd server
npm install
